We're extremely open to pull requests, if you wish to have a feature feel free to develop it and push it to here for review and inclusion in the main project. If you're unable to code something, please raise it as an issue and if we think it has benefit to the community we'll look into developing it for you.

## Why is this a better tool than xyz tool?

We've developed subfinder to solve subdomain finding in a way that we felt worked best for the way we work, and was easily maintainable to allow us and others to add as many sources and features as possible.
