# Project History

This project began it's life as a Bug Bounty World slack channel discussion. @Ice3Man and @codingo_ were talking about how the cornerstone subdomain tool at the time, sublist3r, appeared to have been abandoned. The goal of this project was to make a low dependancy, manageable project in Go that would continue to be maintained over time. @Ice3man decided to rewrite the sublist3r project and posted about it. @codingo_ offered to contribute to the project and subfinder was born.
